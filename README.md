# About Me

Hello! My name is Adrian. I was born and raised in Tucson, AZ, a place I'm proud to call home. I'm currently a student at Pima Community College, I love to spend my time reading, running, and playing basketball with friends. 

## Interests

- **Reading**: Something I've always enjoyed since a child. I'm currently reading "The Bird That Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," which has been a captivating journey so far.
- **Running**: It's my go-to for clearing my mind and staying fit.
- **Basketball**: Playing with friends is one of my favorite ways to unwind and have fun.
