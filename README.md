# hello-world

Hello! My name is Adrian. I was born and raised in Tucson, AZ, a place I'm proud to call home. I'm currently a student at Pima Community College, I love to spend my time reading, running, and playing basketball with friends. I'm currently reading "The Bird That Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," which has been a captivating journey so far.
